									<h2>Cassowary</h2>
									<p>The cassowaries are flightless birds that live in New Guinea, nearby islands, and northeastern Australia. They are famous for their long talons that look like they belong to a dinosaur. 
									They are the third-tallest and second-heaviest living birds.
Cassowaries mainly eat fruit, but sometimes they will eat a range of other plant food, including shoots and grass seeds, in addition to fungi, invertebrates, and small vertebrates. Cassowaries are very shy, but when provoked they are capable of inflicting injuries with their large talons to people.</p>

									<h2>Andean Cock-of-the-Rock</h2>
									<p>The Andean cock-of-the-rock is a large bird native to Andean cloud forests in South America. It is regarded as the national bird of Peru. 

The Andean cock-of-the-rock exhibits marked sexual dimorphism (difference characteristics between male and female besides sexual organs). The male has a large disk-like crest and scarlet or bright orange plumage, but the female is darker and browner. Males get together and complete to breed with females by displaying their plumage and make a lot of different calls. After mating, the female builds the nest and raises the young, all by herself. The Andean cock-of-the-rock eats mostly fruit, but also eats insects, amphibians, reptiles, and small mice.</p>

									<h2>Kiwi</h2>
									<p>Kiwis are flightless birds native to New Zealand and are around the size of a domestic chicken. DNA has confirmed that kiwis are related closer to the Malagasy elephant birds from Madagascar than to the moa with which they shared New Zealand. Kiwi are the smallest living flightless birds  and lay the largest egg in relation to their body size of any species of bird in the world. There are five species, and all of them have been negatively affected by historic deforestation. Luckily, the remaining large areas of their forest habitat are well protected in reserves and national parks. Fun Fact: The kiwi is a national symbol of New Zealand.</p>

									<h2>Elephant Bird</h2>
									<p>This bird is the only one on this list that is, sadly, extinct. Elephant birds were enormous flightless birds that once lived on the island of Madagascar that could grow to be over three meter tall! They became extinct around the 17th or even earlier. Although the exact reason it became extinct is unknown, it is assumed to be caused by humans killing them. Their eggs were about thirteen centimeters in length, which is the largest bird egg ever. Its closest living relative is the kiwi, a far cry from the elephant bird itself.</p>
